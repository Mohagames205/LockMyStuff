# LockMyStuff
This plugin let's you lock your trapdoors, doors and chests

### How to use this plugin?
* Place an iron door and execute the command /lock <name>, then you will have to touch the door you wanted to lock.
* If you want to unlock a door you will have to execute /unlock and then touch the door. You can also use /unlock <name> so you don't have to touch the door.
* Doors can only be unlocked by people with OP. This plugin was made for roleplay purposes, so a normal player will not be able to /unlock a door. The play can however open a door with a key or break the door if the player has the key.
